Overview
This test demonstrates a simple web-based tool to filter and explore various cat breeds using data from The Cat API. The app allows users to display all cat names, filter by health issues, view weight in imperial or metric, and compare intelligence and child-friendliness levels. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Contributions
I have personally worked on setting up the layout, designing the input interface and implementing features like All Names, Health Filter, and basic weight logic. I used ChatGPT to help me properly structure the JavaScript logic, handle API fetching and implement DOM interactions. Similarly, I discussed with my classmate Sandip Khatri about how to handle API fetch and ensure smooth filtering of data.
